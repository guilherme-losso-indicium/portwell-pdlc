# Route

## Purpose
Turn the manifest into a route: what kind of item this is, which company rules it touches, who
therefore has to sign, and how it could be released. The route is a proposal. A person confirms
it at the gate.

## Parameters
`item`, `stage`. Runs in 01-backlog for `type_hypothesis`, in 02-discovery for `route_note`, and
in 05-review for `policy_check` and the wave plan.

## Entry conditions
- Context has run in this stage and `evidence_manifest` is written.
- `states/types.yaml` and `docs/Policies.docx` are readable.

## Reads
- `states/types.yaml`, `states/<stage>/definition.yaml`.
- `evidence_manifest`, `stakeholder_positions`, `decision_draft` if it exists.
- `docs/Policies.docx`, for the literal condition of each policy, its owner, its status and its
  supersession date.
- `data/people/headcount.xlsx`, to write roles as the company records them.

## Prohibited context
- Any reading of a policy beyond its literal text. Where the text and the case do not match
  cleanly, that is a contradiction to record, not a judgment to make.
- Any source outside the two repositories.

## Writes
`route_note` in 02-discovery: `type_proposed`, `type_rationale`, `policies_triggered`,
`deterministic_checks`, `signatories_g2`, `signatories_g3`, `waves_proposed`. `policy_check` in
05-review. `opportunity.type_hypothesis` in 01-backlog.

## Never writes
`type` in the header, which changes only when G2 is signed. Any label such as "scope change" or
"launch" as a conclusion. Any signature.

## Procedure
1. Type. Read `states/types.yaml`. Match the manifest against each type's purpose: a feasibility
   question is a poc, a time-boxed learning release with criteria is a pilot, an increment on
   something in monitoring is a feature, a withdrawal is a deprecation. Write `type_proposed` and
   a `type_rationale` that cites manifest IDs. Where two types fit, write both and stop for the
   decider.
2. Policies. For each policy in `docs/Policies.docx`, test its literal condition against the
   manifest. POLICY-01: is this a billing answer to a Business or Enterprise account. POLICY-03:
   does customer data leave the EU region. POLICY-08: does the account count exceed 25.
   POLICY-11: is a resolution time being quoted. Write each triggered policy with `why`, its
   `owner` as the document names them, and `enforced_by: nothing`, because the document says
   "Nothing checks any of them." Where a superseded policy is cited anywhere in the evidence,
   name its successor.
3. Deterministic checks. Article 4. For each check, write `input` and `result` and nothing else:
   the account count against 25, with the source of the count; each cited policy's status on the
   date of the check; each fact's date against each incident's date. If the count is not on
   record, the result is `cannot count` and the check fails.
4. Signatories. The decider comes from the stage definition. Consents are derived: the owner of
   every triggered policy; support where the outcome lands on the support team; legal where
   personal data is processed; engineering for feasibility at G2 and for rollback at G3; customer
   success where account managers must be briefed. Write each with `because`.
5. Waves. Where the release touches more than one region or more than one tranche of accounts,
   propose waves so that a consent pending for one region blocks only that wave. Each wave has
   accounts, regions and a `go_criteria` that must come from a registered measure.
6. In 05-review, write `policy_check` for every policy the checklist or the draft cites:
   `current`, `superseded_by`, `applies`, `owner`.
7. Propose the next skill in the sequence.

## Evidence produced
A route note a reader can audit line by line: this type because these facts, these policies
because these conditions, these people because these policies, these waves because these regions.

## Proposed transition
None between stages. Proposes act, or escalated through recover when the classification is
disputed in writing.

## Stop and escalation conditions
- Two types fit and the manifest does not separate them: write both, stop, ask the decider.
- A policy's literal wording does not match the case. Example: POLICY-03 says data "leaving the
  EU region" and Tomas Silva applies it to LATAM accounts. Record both readings under
  `contradictions` with `depends` set to the gate. The policy owner decides.
- The account count cannot be established from any document: the POLICY-08 check fails and the
  route says so. Do not take the count from the draft's intention.
- A signatory has no role in `headcount.xlsx`: write the name and `role: unknown`.

## Human judgment boundary
Confirming the type at G2. Interpreting a policy whose text does not match the case. Deciding
whether a change is a scope change or a launch, which a person does with the count in front of
them. The count itself is not a judgment.

## Worked example
OPPORTUNITY-04. Manifest says 28 accounts requested in DECISION-0028 and 40 in the brief. Check:
input 28, threshold 25, result exceeds. POLICY-08 triggered, owner Ana Fialho. POLICY-03
triggered for LATAM, owner Tomas Silva, with the wording mismatch recorded. Signatories for G3:
Ana Fialho decides, Rui Bastos for review capacity, Tomas Silva per region, Kofi Adjei for
rollback and per-account enablement, Gabriela Rocha for account managers and POLICY-11. Waves
proposed: EU and NA first, LATAM when POLICY-03 is signed.
